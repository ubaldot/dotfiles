Repo to keep track of my configs files.

# Usage

```
curl -o ~/clone_dotfiles.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubaldot/dotfiles/main/clone_dotfiles.sh
curl -o ~/clone_dotfiles_win.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubaldot/dotfiles/main/clone_dotfiles_win.sh
```

The scripts will clone this repo and copy the various files in the correct
