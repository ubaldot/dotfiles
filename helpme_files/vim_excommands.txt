EX COMMANDS
-----------
A general command has the form

:[range]cmd

range specifies the lines where cmd shall be executed.

EXAMPLES
--------
:%y             yank the whole file
:%normal @a     run macro a through all the file
:10,15normal $x remove last character from line 10 to line 15
:'a,'by *  copy from marker a to marker b into * register
:23,39norm >> Indent lines 23-39

RANGES
------
:13,15          from line 13 to line 15
:13,+3          from line 13 to line 13+3
:'t,$           from marker t to the end of file
:.,+5           from current line to current line+5
:.,$            from current line to the end

Ranges are always of the form "from line1 to line2" (sequential).
To create ranges of arbitrary lines, use :g (global)

TIPS
----
* to replace stuff in specific "geometrical" positions (for example,
to remove the commas at the end of each line) use macros, e.g.

Example:
--------
qa05xjq (remove first 5 chars in current line and move to next line)
:10,20normal @a

* to replace stuff that follow a certain pattern (no matter where
these guys are located), for example remove all " in a file,
then use :s (substitute)
* to create custom ranges, use :g (global)
