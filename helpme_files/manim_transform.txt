TRANSFORM VS REPLACEMENT TRANSFORM
----------------------------------
=> In both cases mob1 <- mob2.
=> In Transform we always refer always to the first object that just changed shape.
=> In ReplacementTransform we must refer to the second object that overwrite the first object.

Example
self.play(mn.Transform(c, s))  # c takes the shape of s, we continue with c
self.remove(s)

self.play(mn.ReplacementTransform(c, t))  # t completely replace c, we continue with t
self.remove(c)
