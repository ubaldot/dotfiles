--------
* options are builtin variables (you use set for setting them. e.g. set foldmethod = ...).
To see their value you use ?, e.g. :set foldmethod? or :verbose set foldmethod?
To access their value in a script you do e.g. &commentstrings

* To see all the options :options

* ! overwrite any existing, e.g. def! foo() overwrite any other definition of foo() or command! Bar overwrite any other Bar names
* At startup vim silently load defaults.vim

* (legacy)  Place custom functions in

~/.vim/autoload/myfunctions.vim
call myfunctions#foo()

* Put your functions wherever you want and just use import/export mechanism. :h import
* Place filetype specific stuff in ftplugin
* Plugins for the builtin plugin manager shall be placed in

$HOME/.vim/pack/bundle/start/ # Automatically started plugins
$HOME/.vim/pack/bundle/opt/ # Manually started plugins

to start a plugin in opt just run :packadd foo (lazy load)
Otherwise just use a plugin manager.

* Plugin folder is started at vim start
* autoload starts when something inside there is called
* The vimrc is firstly loaded, then the plugins. :scriptnames to see the order.
