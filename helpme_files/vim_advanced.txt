BASICS
------
* options are builtin variables (you use set for setting them. e.g. set foldmethod = ...).
To see their value you use ?, e.g. :set foldmethod? or :verbose set foldmethod?
To access their value in a script you do e.g. &commentstrings

* To see all the options :options

* ! overwrite any existing, e.g. def! foo() overwrite any other definition of foo() or command! Bar overwrite any other Bar names
* At startup vim silently load defaults.vim

* Place custom functions in

~/.vim/autoload/myfunctions.vim
call myfunctions#foo()

* Place filetype specific stuff in ftplugin
* Plugins shall be placed in

$HOME/.vim/pack/bundle/start/ # Automatically started plugins
$HOME/.vim/pack/bundle/opt/ # Manually started plugins

to start a plugin in opt just run :packadd foo (lazy load)

* Plugin folder is started at vim start
* autoload starts when something inside there is called

VIM9SCRIPT
----------
* variables have scope. In reality think as g:, b: and w: as global variables that you can access wherever you are.
Script variables have script scope.

# Won't work
if a > 0
    var x =3
else
    var x =4
echo x # Won't work

# Will work
var x = 0  # Defined a variable in this scope
if a > 0
    var x =3
else
    var x =4
echo x

Note how var x is called and manipulated by other functions written inside the script.

* :h list-functions to search for some specific functions
* :h autocommand-events
