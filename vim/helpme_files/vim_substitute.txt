SUBSTITUTE
----------

:[range]s[ubstitute]/pattern/new/[gci]

replace "pattern" with "new" for all the lines in range. 
gci = global, ask for confirmation, case sensitive.

OBS: Instead of using the delimiter / you can use the delimiter : so you avoid 
things like this -> \\/\//\/\\/

Example:
:10,29s:foo:bar:g
