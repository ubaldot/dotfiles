SUBSTITUTE
----------

:[range]s[ubstitute]/pattern/new/[gci]

replace "pattern" with "new" for all the lines in range.
gci = global, ask for confirmation, case sensitive.

OBS: Instead of using the delimiter / you can use the delimiter : so you avoid
things like this -> \\/\//\/\\/

Example:
:10,29s:foo:bar:g

EXAMPLES
--------
:10,15s:foo:bar:g   Replace foo with bar in lines 10--15
:%s/./bar/g         Replace all characters of non-empty lines with bar in the whole file
:%s/.\w*/bar/g      Replace all the words of non-empty lines with bar in the whole file
:%s:\s*$::g         Remove all the blanks at the end of the line in the whole file
:.,$/"//g           Remove all the " from the current line to the end of the file
:%s:^\s*$:bar:g     Replace all the blank lines with bar in the whole file
:%s/foo/<c-r>a/g    Replace foo with the content of register a in the whole file


RANGES
------
:13,15          from line 13 to line 15
:13,+3          from line 13 to line 13+3
:'t,$           from marker t to the end of file
:.,+5           from current line to current line+5
:.,$            from current line to the end

For custom ranges, use :g (global)

PATTERNS
--------
foo         foo
\<foo\>     foo (match case)
^\s*$       empty-lines

FUNCTION
--------

GetString() -> substitute(path, sub, flags)

var text = "Hello \\123world\\045!"
echom substitute(text, '\\\(\o\o\o\)', (m) => nr2char(str2nr(m[1], 8)), 'g')

The substitute call is made using a lambda function: (m) => str2nr(m[1], 8)
where m is the array of match m[i] corresponds to submatch(i).
m[0] is the whole.
