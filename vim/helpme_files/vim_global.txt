GLOBAL
------
Create ranges of arbitrary lines.
Lines selection is made through a given pattern. 

:[range]g[lobal]/pattern/cmd

If not specified, [range] is the whole file (current line is .)

EXAMPLES OF RANGE CREATION
--------------------------
:g/foo/       Create range with all the lines that contain the word foo
:g/^abcd/     Create range with all the lines that start with abcd
:g/abcd$/     Create range with all the lines that end with abcd
:g/^\s*/      Create range with all the lines that start with an arbitrary number of spaces
:13,28g/foo/  Create range with all the lines from 13 to 28 that contains the word foo
:22,42g!/foo/ Create range with all lines from 22 to 48 that DOES NOT contain the word foo

PATTERNS
--------
foo         lines that contains foo
\<foo\>     lines that contains foo (match case)
.           non-empty lines
^\s*$       empty-lines
^foo        lines that start with foo
bar$        lines that end with bar

COMPLETE EXAMPLES
-----------------
:g/^abcd/normal $x      Delete the last character in all the lines that start with abcd
:g/./normal A;          Append ; at the end of all non-empty lines
:g/^az/exe "normal x"   Select all lines starting with az and something powerful...  
:g/foo/d _              Delete all the lines that contains the word foo (note the _ at the end)
:g/^\s*$/m$             Move all the blank lines to the bottom
:g/one\|two/d/t$        Copy all the lines that contain one or two to the end of file
:g/foo/z#.5|echo "==========" Display the first 5 lines that contain foo
:g/foo/y A              Copy all the lines that contain foo in register A
:g/pippo$/s/foo/bar     Substitute foo with bar in all the lines that end with pippo

NOTES
-----
:g! is the opposite of the pattern, i.e. :g!/foo/ select all the lines that
don't contain the word foo

OBS: If you delete, use _ (black hole register) to avoid filling all the registers!
