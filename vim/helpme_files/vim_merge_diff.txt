DIFF
In principle you could just vimdiff file1 file2 from any terminal window.
Or, inside of Vim, you can:

:diffsplit {filename}   compare this buffer with {filename}. You can use <tab>
                        for selecting the file in a wildmenu.

:diffthis               select arguments for vimddiff.
                        E.g. If I am on buff1 and I :diffthis and then
                        on buff2 I :diffthis, then they are selected.
                        Now, I have to place them manually side-by-side.

:diffget [buf]          get the difference from the other buffer (or do)
:diffput [buf]          put the difference to the other file (or dp)

:diffupdate             Run it every once in a while
:diffoff[!]             stop the diff thing. ! also close the current window.

-- USER DEFINED --
:Diff - compare the current buffer with the last saved buffer
:Diff hbw923 - compare the current buffer with hbw923 commit

INSIDE VIMDIFF
<c-w>h - to be in the window with the merged file
:diffget <TAB> - choose who you want to keep (LOCAL or REMOTE)

:wqa - save and close everything

CONFLICTS
git mergetool

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
git rebase --abort
git reset --hard <commit-id>

HELP
:h diff
