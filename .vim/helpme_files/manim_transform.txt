TRANSFORM VS REPLACEMENT TRANSFORM
----------------------------------
=> In both cases mob1 <- mob2.
=> In Transform we always refer always to the first object that just changed shape.
=> In ReplacementTransform we must refer to the second object that overwrite the first object.

Example
self.play(mn.Transform(c, s))  # c takes the shape of s, we continue with c
self.remove(s)

self.play(mn.ReplacementTransform(c, s))  # c takes the shape of s, we continue with s
self.remove(c)
(OBS! c is actually replaced!)

=> If s is invisible there is not much difference
=> If both c and s are visible, then there is a lot of difference!

MOVE_TO VS SHIFT
----------------
move_to: absolute position

  cos_x.move_to(mn.DOWN) # Move to [0,-1,0]
  cos_x_shift_to(mn.DOWN) # Move to cos_x.get_center() + mn.DOWN

Remember that also exist next_to and align_to.
