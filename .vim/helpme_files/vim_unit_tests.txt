HOW TO RUN TEST WHEN CONTRIBUTING TO VIM
-----------------------------------------

1. Build vim from ~/vim_official/vim/src with make
2. Write your test in ~/vim_official/vim/src/testdir
3. Source the script with vim --clean and run :call <tab> and select your function
4. Add some sleep X to be able to watch what happens during the test
5. Run make clean and then make test_<your_tests>

HOW TO RUN TEST OF MY PLUGINS
-----------------------------
1. Test names shall start with g:Test_...
2. You can call your test function from within Vim with :call Test_...
3. Use echom assert... so you can see if a test passed or not (0 passed, 1
   failed)
4. After a echom you may need a redraw command
5. See markdown-extras for a good example.
